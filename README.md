# 🧠 CNN-Based Stress Detection Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **facial expression-based stress detection system**. The goal is to automatically detect stress levels in a person using a deep learning model trained on facial images.  

We built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify facial expressions into emotions like *happy, angry, sad, neutral*, etc., which helps estimate stress.  

The model is deployed as a **web application using Streamlit**, so users can upload images and instantly see predictions.

## 🔍 What We Did Step by Step

1. **Data Collection**
   - Collected facial expression images from a dataset.
   - Images were labeled with emotions.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Converted images to **grayscale** for model training.
   - Applied **data augmentation** (like rotation, zoom, flips) to increase dataset size and make the model robust.

3. **Model Development**
   - Built a **CNN from scratch** to classify emotions.
   - Used layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense.
   - Trained the model on the preprocessed images.

4. **Training and Evaluation**
   - Trained the model using 50+ epochs.
   - Monitored validation accuracy and used **EarlyStopping** to prevent overfitting.
   - Achieved around **60% accuracy** on original grayscale images.

5. **Improving Accuracy**
   - Applied **data augmentation** to increase dataset variability.
   - Experimented with **transfer learning** using pre-trained models (like VGG16) to leverage existing knowledge and improve performance.

6. **Prediction**
   - Built a Python script to load the trained model and predict stress from **new images**.
   - Converted color images to grayscale if necessary to match training format.

7. **Deployment**
   - Used **Streamlit** to create an interactive web app.
   - Users can upload images and get **real-time stress predictions**.
   - Pushed the project to **GitHub** and used **Git LFS** for storing the trained model (`.h5` file).
   - Deployed successfully on **Streamlit Cloud**.
